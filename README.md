## Usage
Create a file to store messages, or adjust the message storage to your choice. Then simply reply to a message with "$add" to add a message to the list of messages, and use "$random" to get a random message. The messages don't just have to be ones that are out of context, you can use the bot to store any kind of discord messages you want.
